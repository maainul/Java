# Difference Between Super(), super, this() and this.

## Use of Super and this

super call parent class variable.

this keyword call the child class/current class variable.

```.java
package constructor;

class P {
	String string = "Parent";
}

class C extends P {
	String string = "Child";

	public void m1() {
		System.out.println(string); // child
		System.out.println(this.string); // child
		System.out.println(super.string); // parent
	}
}

public class SuperAndThis {

	public static void rotateDigit(String[] args) {
		C obj = new C();
		obj.m1();

	}

}
Child
Child
Parent
```
### Super(), this():

1. These are constructor calls to call super and current class constructor.

2. we can use only in constructor as first statement only.

3. We can use only one but not both simontenwously.


### Super, this:

1. These are keyword  to refer super class  and current class instance members.

2. we can use anywhere except static area.

3. We can use both simontenwously.
