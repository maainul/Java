# Binary Tree
Binary Tree: A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. 
Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child. 

**Full Binary Tree A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children. The following are the examples of a full binary tree. We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaf nodes have two children.**

                   /  \
                 100   40
**Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is a Complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible**

The following are examples of Complete Binary Trees 



               18
           /       \  
         15         30

      40    50    100   40


               18

         15         30

Practical example of Complete Binary Tree is Binary Heap. 

**Perfect Binary Tree A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level. 
The following are the examples of Perfect Binary Trees.**
