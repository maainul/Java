***Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, 
sometimes referred to as a 'search key'[1]), 
and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.***
