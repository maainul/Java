# Graph

## Defination: 
```
A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.

## Characteristics
```
	1. A graph data structure ( non-linear data structure ).
	2. Collection of nodes that have data.
	3. Connected to other nodes.
```
```
More precisely, a graph is a data structure (V, E) that consists of

A collection of vertices V
A collection of edges E, represented as ordered pairs of vertices (u,v)

```
V = {0,1,2,3,4} 
E = {(0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3)}.
G = {V, E}

Order of Graph = Number of vertices of a Graph (5)
Size of Graph = Number of Edge of a graph(7)
```

## Uses Of GRAPH
``` 
	1. Represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. 
	2. Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. 
	For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). 
	Each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, locale etc.
