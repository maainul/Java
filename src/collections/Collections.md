# Collections in Java

```
The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture 
to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as 
searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

Java Collection means a single unit of objects. 

Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and 
classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet,

```

# What is a framework in Java

```
It provides readymade architecture.
It represents a set of classes and interfaces.
It is optional.
```

# What is Collection framework

```
The Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. 
It has:

	1. Interfaces and its implementations, i.e., classes
	2. Algorithm
