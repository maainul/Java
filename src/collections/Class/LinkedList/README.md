# Java LinkedList class
```
Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements. 
It provides a linked-list data structure. 
It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.
```
# The important points about Java LinkedList are:

```
Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order.
Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur.
Java LinkedList class can be used as a list, stack or queue.
```
# Hierarchy of LinkedList class

Java LinkedList class extends AbstractSequentialList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.

# Doubly Linked List
```
In the case of a doubly linked list, we can add or remove elements from both sides.
