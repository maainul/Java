# Rules of Constructor:

1. Name of the construtor and name of the class will be same.

2. No return type.

3. Modifiers : public,private,protected and default
	
			public - anywhere you can create object.

			private - within that class you can crate object.

			default - within same package you can create object.

			protect - within same package and child class.

## Can we create a methiod same as class name.

yes 

```.java
class Test{
	void Test(){
		sout("hello");
	}
	psvm(String args[]){
		Test ob = new Test();
		Test ob2 = new Test();
	}
}

// no error will be happend because compiler treated Test as a method.
But it is not recommended  practice.
```
