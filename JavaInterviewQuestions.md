### 2. What do you understand by using of final keyword with classes and variables as well, give case where you will prefer to use final?
### 3. What is type casting? Suppose there is a data which is of type double then how can you show that double in int data type?
### 4. What are the rotateDigit advantages of polymorphism? And what is the alternate of polymorphism?
### 5. What is constructor chaining in java?

### How JVM knows about your program and what is the cycle of code execution in java?
### Difference between public, private and protected modifiers and explain why do you need all these modifiers in your code?
### What will be the result If java set rotateDigit method to private?
### What is command line argument and how can you give order to java program to execute a file reading operation by command line argument?
### Where do you need super constructor and suppose you don’t have super constructor then is there any way to execute super class constructor, if yes then explain?
### Interface is about 100% abstraction, what do you understand by 100% abstraction and how can you achieve 100% abstraction in java? Write the same program from both interface and abstract class, now as you can write same code with abstract class then why do you need interface in java?
### What is multilevel inheritance in java? And does java support multiple inheritance , explain your thoughts?
### Java is object oriented language, explain both object and oriented word ?
### What do you understand by design patterns in oops, if you have to design your own patterns then what are the parameters you will consider most?
### Write some basic programs like: 
    <1>. Palindrome,
    < 2>. String reverse, 
    <3>.Patterns of stars in all possible ways, 
    <4>.Find out minimum and maximum numbers in a given array, 
    <5>.You are given city name and person name blank array of fixed sized, write a program to get the city name of a person. 
    You have to take city name and person name at run time, 
    <6>.Write matrix multiplication program in java,
    <7>.How will you break a array in equal part. Consider all possible cases, 
    <8>.Write a program using switch case where you have to ask day name from user and then you will print first three letter of that   day in capital letter as response to user,
    <9>. Ask user to give a string as input then show repeated letters with count as response, 
    <10>.Convert any given number into binary format, 
    <11>.Read context from a file and replace every small letter into capital and every capital letter into small letter and then print the modified file as response of program,
    <12>.Write a program where program will ask to user about name, age, address and college name, then you will print the detail in a order but if user repeat the same name again then show available data of user.
### What do you understand by break and continue keyword in iteration?
### Write all possible syntax of for loop?
### What are the difference between while and for loop? And explain the cases where which one suits better?
### What do you understand by variable scope? Is it required to initialize the local variable explain why so?
### What is interpreter in java? And difference between compilation and interpretation in java?
### What do you get by mean of return type in java? And suppose you have to return int data but return type of method is double, explain will it work or not?
### Whether you can override super class methods or variables? Explain it?
### What is object chaining in java?
### Difference between parameters and arguments in java?
### Write a singleton class in java? And where, why you will prefer singleton in any case?
### As java have multi threaded programming nature, first explain what is it? Then : 
    <1>.Why do you need it? 
    <2>.Explain and write every possible case to create a thread in java? ❤
    >What is thread sleeping mean in java?
    <4>.Suppose you have two different files at any location then write a program with 
    two threads where every single thread will read and print single file but both will do the operation at same time. 
    So file 1 will be read by thread 1 and file 2 will be read by thread 2. 
    <5>.Explain thread architecture in java? <6>.What is thread pooling in java? 
    <7>.Read some basic function related to multithreading in java.
### Whether java is procedural language or functional language explain it?
### What are the parameters that makes java different from other language give some practical examples where java suits better than any other language.
### Why exception handling is introduced in java? List down all the causes behind this?
### Lets consider java is not having error handling mechanism then write a function where you need to handle ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException yourself. 
### Difference between try, catch and finally?
### Consider your body as a task and then design every body part as per oops concept. (think as per your convenience).
